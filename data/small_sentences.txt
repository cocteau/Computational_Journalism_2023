The COMPLAINT ID XXXX.
In XXXX, XXXX I pulled my three main credit bureau reports.
SPS needs to send the final modification to my work address so that I am guaranteed to receive it.
She told me this was in my contract and unfortunately it took me to correct her employees and this would not happen again.

I believe they are spoofing phone numbers.
They informed me again, nothing they can do.

I told XXXX XXXX they had 24-hours to sort this out with USAA and get back with me and they have not.

We, they, are public servants that aim to not only protect us but also protect our credit from erroneous or wrong information.
I 've called the Experian multiple times and also the companies to get these inquiries removed that I had no knowledge of with no results.
Therefore, I expect these listed accounts to be deleted and blocked within ( 4 ) business days.
It makes me wonder how much of my former credit problems may have been caused this same manner and missed on my part prior to paying in effort of repairing my credit.
